Kentish Town Station:The walk begins from Kentish Town Station. Leave the station and head south down Kentish Town Road. 

For many centuries Kentish Town was a small hamlet outside London that grew up in the shadow of nearby St Pancras Church. The latter may have been badly affected by flooding from the Fleet River, and so a chapel of ease was built near here in the 13th century. A few cottages, and later inns, sprung up, alongside the bank of the Fleet River that once dominated this area before urbanisation drove it underground.   The origin of the district’s name is most probably linked to the river, a corruption of  old English words ‘Ken-ditch’ meaning ‘bed of a waterway’. 

Look back at the station itself, a fine example of the [ox-blood] tiles that are such a feature of [  ], one of London’s most prolific underground station designers.;River Fleet:As you walk along you will soon realise Kentish Town is a busy place – one that has been considerably gentrified in recent years, but keeping a little of its old edge.  There are a mix of mediocre 20th century and Victorian buildings – an example of the latter being The Oxford public house just a short way down on the left by Islip Street.  In the 17th and 18th centuries wealthy people built country houses in the area, surrounded by hay fields and farms, with the River Fleet running right through the area.  
 
The River Fleet starts in two places – one on Hampstead Heath, the other in Highgate.  Long since pushed underground, the two parts of the river meet just north of Kentish Town, and continue underground today right through London before emptying into the Thames at [ ]. It is hard to imagine in the modern age how important it was for Londoners of the past to be near to water, and sadly there is very little to remind visitors to Kentish Town of the river that still flows underneath and which was once so prominent to day to day life here.;Rio's Relaxation Spa:Today Kentish Town Road is like many British shopping streets – tattoo and charity shops found beside tanning salons,  with more upmarket cafes.   On the right (west) side you pass Rio’s ‘Relaxation Spa’ – a reminder of this part of London’s more sleazy past, although many of the massage parlours in the district have now gone as the area has moved upmarket.;Greek Orthodox Cathedral:The striking Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St Andrew. It originated in 1885 as an Anglican church dedicated to St Barnabas, and was later converted in 1957 for use by the Greek community.;Kelly Street:Originally Church Street, it was re-named after local housing developer John Kelly in 1870.  Walk a hundred yards or so to see the pretty painted houses.  No one seems to know what kick started the decision by residents to make such an effort to paint their houses this way, but it seems to have begun in the 1960s.   Kelly Street is typical of the gentrification that has taken place of many parts of Kentish Town – in the late 90s two or three bedroom houses sold here for around £180,000, whereas in recent years they are more likely to sell for over £1million. Walk along Kelly Street then right into Castlehaven Road, heading north to reach Prince of Wales road.;Public Baths:To your right are the huge public baths dating from [1900], and part of the great drive by authorities in the Victorian and Edwardian age to provide amenities for ordinary people who often had no running water or bathroom at home. Cross over and walk a short way down Grafton Road, looking out for the old signage for ‘Public Washhouse’ and ‘Ladies Baths’.;Piano Manufacture:At the end of Perren Street is a building that is a relic of Kentish Town’s industrial past. This was once home to the Imperial Works and pianos and organs were manufactured here.  The north end of Ryland Road was also the site of a major piano factory in the late 19th century. A few properties in this road still have WWII Anderson Shelters now used as garden sheds.;Collège français bilingue de Londres:A French  school that opened in 2011 to cater for the explosion of demand for London’s many French-speaking residents. It is housed in an old school that dates from 1874, significant as it is one of many such establishments that were constructed after the ground-breaking Education Act of 1870 began to roll out a State funded education for ordinary people.;Anglers Lane:This is just one of several local streets whose names are a reminder of the age when the Fleet River flowed above ground.;The Assembly House:An old inn stood here where travellers would assemble before heading further out of London – many hoping for safety in numbers as a protection against highwaymen. In 1850 one person also described ‘The old Assembly House of very long standing was held in great repute, being a pleasant distance from London, when those who sought a Country Walk could meet there with every enjoyment a Coutry Inn could supply;The Forum:Just a short way along Highgate Road is The Forum, one of London’s most famous music venues.  It used to be a cinema, built in [?].  Opposite used to stand the Tally Ho pub, recently demolished and where by most accounts where ‘pub rock’ scene began in the early 70s, where bands such as Ian Dury's Kilburn and the High Roads, the Hot Rods and Dr Feelgood received a loyal following, and helped create the energy from which Punk emerged. Walk up Highgate Road, broadly following the route of one brook of the Fleet River.;College Lane:College Lane is said to contain the oldest buildings in Kentish Town and dating from the 1780s. It contains by numbers 13 and 14 a rare plaque commemorating the fallen of WWI, said to be the only such memorial to be found on a residential house in London. It remembers ten local men who died in Flanders and Northern France, although it is almost illegible today.  One man – Lieutenant-Sergeant Alfred Stanton died from his wounds right at the end of the war in October 1918.;The Junction Tavern:On the corner is yet another imposing Victorian pub, dating from 1885 and where actor Damian Lewis has been reported to be regular in recent years.;Fortress Road: ;Falkland Road:;The Pineapple:One of the best pubs in the area and worth a visit to recover from the walk.
